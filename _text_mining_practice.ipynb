            "\"With all this stuff going down at the moment with MJ i've started listening to his music, watching the odd documentary here and there, watched The Wiz and watched Moonwalker again. Maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent. Moonwalker is part biography, part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released. Some of it has subtle messages about MJ's feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad m'kay.<br /><br />Visually impressive but of course this is all about Michael Jackson so unless you remotely like MJ in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring. Some may call MJ an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie BUT MJ and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of him.<br /><br />The actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the Smooth Criminal sequence and Joe Pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord. Why he wants MJ dead so bad is beyond me. Because MJ overheard his plans? Nah, Joe Pesci's character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno, maybe he just hates MJ's music.<br /><br />Lots of cool things in this like MJ turning into a car and a robot and the whole Speed Demon sequence. Also, the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy Bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene.<br /><br />Bottom line, this movie is for people who like MJ on one level or another (which i think is most people). If not, then stay away. It does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically MJ's bestest buddy in this movie is a girl! Michael Jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty? Well, with all the attention i've gave this subject....hmmm well i don't know because people can be different behind closed doors, i know this for a fact. He is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest liars. I hope he is not the latter.\"\n"

was an empty fridge which came quite handy for our own beverages, I doubt they would have milk in their minibar  ,  Tea and coffee making facilites and iron with board were a great bonus to what we

seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way

coffee breakfast restaurant across the street from the tube stop on Gloucester Road that served a good English breakfast at a decent price .\\n51

                                Would definitely recommend this hotel if only for the fair price I got on priceline combined with the great, convenient location, which made it easy to get to all the

get the worst rooms because the price was so good but got a great room on the 16th floor facing the London Eye .\\n53

food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n55

                                  However, the first price that they charged me was too much so I had to get a refund then be charged the correct amount for a standard room .\\n56

hotel for one night due to a number of factors ,  the location, the price   the availibility of a room to accomodate three adults .\\n60

booking until you actually processed the booking and paid for the room ,  this is apparently now normal for many London hotels which I'd never experienced before ,  we ended up paying \\u00a317 more per night than I'd expected .\\n61

was an empty fridge which came quite handy for our own beverages, I doubt they would have milk in their minibar  ,  Tea and coffee making facilites and iron with board were a great bonus to what we had expected from our room .\\n91

however, when it came to the continental breakfast, the hotel would not permit us to partake of same, telling us that because we reserved through Hotwire, we were ineligible for the breakfast .\\n95

           Garmin's nuvi 255W   is a handy little device that provides excellent value, but more importantly spot on directions .\\n6                                                 While I recommend that you refrain from entering a directions request while driving your car, I note that some of the more impressive features of this GPS are literally one touch away, and so mounting the device close enough to you to activite a one touch feature would seem to be relatively important .\\n7                                                                                                       But leaving it on the seat next to you is likely to cause a few double takes because as comfortable as you think you're going to be just listening for directions, the fact remains that the graphics will attract your eyeballs like a moth to a flame .\\n8

                                           but for the most part, we find that the Garmin software provides accurate directions, whereever we intend to go .\\n10                                                                                                                                         Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n11

doesn't make you type in complete directions when it isn't necessary .\\n12                                                                                                                                       The only other annoyance of any time is that if you deviate from your route and don't indicate that you are detouring, you get to hear the Garmin repeatedly chastize you because it has to recalulate your directions .\\n13

although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n34

on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .\\n39

it cannot give directions to the road .\\n40

 My only real gripes on the software interface side would be its inability to show 1, way streets on your overhead map   and that this particular model does not support the Garmin routing feature that you can sync between your PC and their more expensive models to pick multiple waypoints instead of just a point 'A' to point 'B' directions system .\\n42

turn, by, turn directions from the program, and Google Maps has features that work with Garmin units .\\n43                                                                                                                                         Any time you're facing a closed roadway or are terribly stuck in highway traffic, you'll get a very slick change in directions to your destination given to you in literally less than 5 seconds than you ask for it .\\n44

                                                        The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n47

by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n48

driving one day in downtown Sacramento .\\n49

                                                                                                                                                                                    I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                        I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n52

directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                        Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The directions were pretty right on, with a brief glitch with the distance it was calculating for some approaching streets .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                     I am sure I've not even touched upon the many features this GPS boasts, but for basic travel directions for the non, techie then this is a great product .\\n56

wife, asking her to plot a course using a mapping Web site and recite the directions .\\n57                                                                                                                   Daughter Dearest now carries the Nuvi in the glove box of her car, pulling it out, plugging it in, and getting directions whenever she needs, in a manner that notably is much faster and clearer than reading a map or calling her mother .\\n58

.\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n60

                       I mainly bought the first one for my wife since she needs directions alot of the time .\\n61

well that people from the wedding were following me for directions .\\n62

speed I am traveling .\\n63                                                                                                                                    The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n64

Amazon had the best price for this model which I chose for its ability to adjust the directions if you reroute, text to speech feature and 4 .\\n65

or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .\\n71

                                   I chose small towns as destinations and it always led me there without any problems, thus allowing me to enjoy the scenery of the fall foliage without worrying about

                                                       Hotfix   to lock on to satellite signals works well .\\n6                                                                                                                                                         On I, 76 in PA, I travelled through a mile long tunnel and it tracked me perfectly even though it obviously could not get satellite signals inside the tunnel .\\n7                                                           Acquiring satellites is very fast though if you are moving while the acquisition is taking place it will take a little longer to acquire a satellite and of course on a overcast day you may experience difficulty acquiring a signal though understandable .\\n8

minutes or less, the other 10% is due to the above events .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                 And it is very fast locating satellites, the new interface needs some time to get used to, it is very cool now you can drag the map with your fingers !\\n10

is quick in picking up satellite signals and very responsive with the user interface   .\\n11

traffic jams we encountered I guess it loss contact with the satellites due to interferrence by the tall buildings arroung .\\n13                   Can pay like $200 or something and get the service for life, HotFix which allows it to get satellites much faster when booting up this is a great feature and my only complaint about past Garmins that I used which was that it took too long to acquire satellites, this eliminates that problem .\\n14                                                                                      by the time the main menu comes up after turning the device on it generally already has a full 100% signal from the satellites and it's ready to navigate, a beautiful crystal clear LCD widescreen, and tons of other features .\\n15

             Satellite acquisition time is very fast, as is re, routing .\\n16                                                                                                                                                     It also has a  hot fix  which finds satellites faster ,  which is very useful for starting your trip immediately and great for recalculating routes very quickly .\\n17

    I took the unit outside to do that, and it found the satellites very quickly .\\n42

have time to really read up on the gadget so there may be features I don't know about, but just have to link it up to the satellites and off you go .\\n46

is probably the first thing worth mentioning, being a 10 minutes walk from the natural history museum, a 15 minutes walk from beautiful Hyde Park and just behind the corner of the Gloucester Road underground station   .\\n87

                                                  Another word of warning when booking through the Holiday Inn website ,  VAT was NOT included in the price at the time of booking until you actually processed the booking and paid for the room ,  this is apparently now normal for many London hotels which I'd never experienced before ,  we ended up paying \\u00a317 more per night than I'd expected

at least check out other reliable hotels, there are many shockers at all price ranges, do your research  !\\n141

.\\n5     The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

correctly, and it has almost caused me to get into an accident twice .\\n7

price for your old Kindle on Amazon's Marketplace, craigslist, wherever .\\n2    Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                    However, I think all the positives of the K2 greatly make it worth the price which I'll talk about below .\\n4

                                  Konrath are offering novels at prices ranging from $1 to $2 dollars, as a way to find new readers .\\n14

                                                                                                                                  Is the K2 so much better than the K1 as to justify the price ?\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                                         the BUT comes in and applies to the fact that the price for the downloads has been going up and up .\\n22

reduced price of book downloads .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                 The lack of such an obvious and necessary feature, especially considering the price of the device, really degrades its value and usability .\\n24                                                 I want you to know that ultimately, however, if I want a Kindle I will have to capitulate and accept Amazon's terms because Amazon has a monopoly over their own machine, and I will have to purchase one even at prices I believe are needlessly high for e, book readers .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                And I know for sure that many print publishers will see this as an opportunity to provide attractively priced paper books as an alternative .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  At the steep price of this device we should get better quality components .\\n27                                                                                                                            To have this continuous, high speed, wireless connectivity without the need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the Kindle truly irrelevant .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                     price  , and intuitive operation your parents and grandparents can operate this device, if you are fortunate enough to still have them !\\n29                                                                                                                                                                               As a teacher, I really wanted this machine and have been waiting for the price to drop so that I could give myself the excuse to purchase it .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Disappointing given the prices .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The price for new hardbacks on the Kindle is great too .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               After reading the reviews and pondering the price all day, I took the plunge .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                             The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .\\n34                                                                                                                                                       If you are searching for a REAL review on the Kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .\\n35                          However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                           Those in college, with children or just have a love of reading will likely find the convenience and savings well worth the price .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I found many simply by doing a search on genre's of interest with price  low to high  as a default .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     To justify the purchase price, those functions really need to be there .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The price of these 'classic' titles is pretty hard to beat, too .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                            I was a little miffed when i saw that they would now be charging for the Kindle cover, which was included in the price for the previous version .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                              Mind you, it's the same size as the Kindle 1, and that of most book pages, but I for one dream of something larger without a larger price tag .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If I have to spend the full puirchase price on the K2 with a K1 still in hand I would have probably waited .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Although pricey, the real value of this purchase is that it got me to read again .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                        But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I just hope that the price goes down .\\n46                                                                                                                                            Yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the Kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                         But given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                            That may not be true for everyone, but, as I said, I'm sure the price will eventually come down .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                              Some people may find this an inconvenience, but I think it is just a small price to pay for delayed convenience especially where I am located .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Books are retardedly pricey .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Should have been priced at $250  .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Even if you want to , I think it is way too pricey .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The subscription prices and book prices are really good from what my wife tells me .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Though it would be nice if the cover was included in the K2 price, it is still worth buying .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is pricey but if you buy as many books as I do, it will pay for itself within a year due to the low cost of most books .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                The price of the device itself is the only drawback but if your an avid reader like myself the reward far outways the price .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                        The price, tag is pretty

this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

comfy leather seats .\\n33   The front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here .\\n32                                                                                                                                              However the hotel is very large and loses some personal service as a result ,  the service we received was variable, with little recognition of our Platinum Priority

                                               There is also a laundry service at the hotel, but they also change an outrageous amount so unless you have an expense account I wouldn't plan on using it

  on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n71

                                                    However, when we arrived at our room there was a maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n38

                                         There is a wall, mounted hair dryer in the bathroom .\\n40

the most was the bathroom was very dated .\\n41

                                            Upon our arrival, there was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The bathroom was adequate with thick, fluffy towels .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The bathroom was large and private .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                              The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47

which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

      The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

hairdryer .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

.\\n57

                                                                                                                                                                         Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

tons of space especially in the bathroom .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                               We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .\\n61

bathroom had a crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n63

Bathrooms, though, are plenty big .\\n64                                                                                                                                                          Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                        It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66

plenty of thick towels in the bathroom, and all the usual toiletries, hair, dryer, etc .\\n67

rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n68

                                                                                                                                                                                                              Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70

home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71

by the bathroom sink .\\n72

the room was the bathroom, it was not up to the standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n74

    The bathroom was just okay, but for the price we survived .\\n75

our room .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The reasonable price of the hotel allowed us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .\\n77

to the fit and finish of previous Camrys   .\\n55    Examples include fit and finish  had to have the drivers door realigned due to metal, to, metal contact causing terrible rattling  , poor fit of interior parts, which causes a lot of rattling, especially when it's cold out  the auto tranny has a history of serious problems and acts weird, and lastly the paint quality, which chips very easily

pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47

                                                     Seats are padded more firmly than previous model but comfortable on trips .\\n49

we never had on previous vehicles .\\n81                                               I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all

minimal .\\n86                                                                                                                                 The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3

has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95

comfort factor .\\n104                                                                                                                                                While the '03 was roomy and comfortable, the steering and handling were very vague .\\n105                           The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .\\n106

                                   the variable cylinder management changes to 4 cyl when not under load, this helps with fuel mileage .\\n33

                               Aside from missing the turbo's acceleration, I've preferred the Accord's better mileage, handling and comfort .\\n38

                                                                                                                                     So beware, if you are trading in your V8 for a mileage vehicle, this is not it in my case .\\n40                                                                                                                                                     The car is getting

                                       In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62                                                                                                                         While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64                                                                                                                                     Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .\\n65                                                                                                                                       I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage .\\n66

                                                                        Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71

models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76

                                                                                                                                      Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                            190 hp and superior gas mileage .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                 It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83                                                                                                                                                  The Gas mileage is good, the acceleration sometime is slow when cold from 1st to 2nd gear .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                     I hope to get better mileage on extended highway trips .\\n85                                                                                                          I think the mileage would be even better with a 6, speed stick shift to drop the tachometer from ~2300 rpm to <2000 rpm at 60 mph .\\n86

great fuel mileage 28, 30 combined .\\n88                                                                                                                                                                            I am not known to drive slowly so I am pleased with the mileage .\\n89                                                                                                         We bought this car with the expectations of getting a car that feels good with my bad back, gets good gas mileage, and is reliable .\\n90                                                                                                                       So far, the reliability has been as expected, it is comfortable on my back, and the gas mileage has been pretty good .\\n91

was an empty fridge which came quite handy for our own beverages, I doubt they would have milk in their minibar  ,  Tea and coffee making facilites and iron with board were a great bonus to what we

seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way
